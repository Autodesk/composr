## Reporting Issues and Asking Questions

Before opening an issue, please search the issue tracker to make sure your issue hasn't already been reported.

### Bugs and Improvements

We use the issue tracker to keep track of bugs and improvements to Redux itself, its examples, 
and the documentation. We encourage you to open issues to discuss improvements, architecture, theory, 
internal implementation, etc. If a topic has been discussed before, we will ask you to join the previous discussion.

## Development

#### Building Composr

Running the `build` task will create a static build of the project to `/dist`.

```
$ npm run build
```

## Docs

Help with documentation is more than welcome.
It can come in a way of guides, tutorials, examples and code documentation.

## How To Contribute
A great guide for contributing to git projects from Mr.doob: [A Contributor's Guide to the Git Galaxy](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/A-Contributor%27s-Guide-to-the-Git-Galaxy#basic-workflow-creating-a-pull-request)

Help would always be wanted in new Geometry and Deformer types! Any other suggestions for features would be accepted as well. 



Thanks you for contributing!
